# Architecture Principles

## Core Design Principles
- **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services for scalability and maintainability
- **API-First Design**: All services communicate through well-defined APIs
- **Serverless-First Approach**: Leverage serverless functions for cost efficiency and auto-scaling
- **Real-Time Processing**: Event-driven architecture for responsive user experience
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Analytics and monitoring inform system optimization
- **Security by Design**: Multi-layered security throughout the architecture
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error handling
