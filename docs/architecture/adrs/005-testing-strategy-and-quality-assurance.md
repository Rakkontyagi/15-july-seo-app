## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-16

## Context
A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for the SEO content generation platform to ensure:

- Code quality and maintainability
- Reliable functionality across all features
- Performance under various load conditions
- Security and data protection
- User experience consistency
- API integration reliability

We need to establish testing frameworks, coverage targets, and quality gates.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy using:
- **Jest** for unit and integration testing
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** for API mocking
- **Automated quality gates** in CI/CD pipeline

## Rationale

### Testing Framework Selection:

#### Jest for Unit/Integration Testing:
1. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with Next.js
2. **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive matcher library and community support
3. **Snapshot Testing**: Easy component and output validation
4. **Mocking Capabilities**: Powerful mocking for external dependencies
5. **Performance**: Fast test execution with parallel running

#### Playwright for E2E Testing:
1. **Cross-Browser**: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit support
2. **Real Browser Testing**: Actual browser automation
3. **Network Interception**: Mock API responses in E2E tests
4. **Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison capabilities
5. **Debugging**: Excellent debugging tools and trace viewer

#### React Testing Library:
1. **User-Centric**: Tests behavior rather than implementation
2. **Accessibility**: Encourages accessible component design
3. **Simple API**: Easy to write and maintain tests
4. **Best Practices**: Promotes testing best practices

## Testing Architecture

### Test Types and Coverage Targets:

#### Unit Tests (70% of total tests):
- **Target Coverage**: 80% code coverage minimum
- **Focus**: Individual functions, utilities, and components
- **Tools**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Example**: API client functions, utility libraries, UI components

#### Integration Tests (20% of total tests):
- **Target Coverage**: All critical user flows
- **Focus**: Component interactions and API integrations
- **Tools**: Jest + MSW for API mocking
- **Example**: Form submissions, data fetching, authentication flows

#### End-to-End Tests (10% of total tests):
- **Target Coverage**: Core user journeys
- **Focus**: Complete user workflows
- **Tools**: Playwright
- **Example**: User registration, content generation, project management

### Testing Environments:

```typescript
// Test Configuration Structure
interface TestConfig {
  unit: {
    framework: 'jest';
    coverage: {
      threshold: 80;
      reporters: ['text', 'html', 'lcov'];
    };
  };
  integration: {
    apiMocking: 'msw';
    database: 'test-supabase-instance';
  };
  e2e: {
    browsers: ['chromium', 'firefox'];
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000';
  };
}
```

## Quality Gates and Standards

### Pre-Commit Hooks:
1. **Linting**: ESLint with strict rules
2. **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode validation
3. **Test Execution**: Run affected tests
4. **Code Formatting**: Prettier formatting

### CI/CD Pipeline Checks:
1. **All Tests Pass**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
2. **Coverage Threshold**: Minimum 80% code coverage
3. **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript errors
4. **Security Audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Performance Budget**: Bundle size and lighthouse scores

### Code Review Requirements:
1. **Test Coverage**: New features must include tests
2. **Security Review**: External API integrations
3. **Performance Impact**: Large component changes
4. **Accessibility**: UI component changes

## Mock Strategy

### External API Mocking:
```typescript
// MSW handlers for external APIs
const handlers = [
  rest.get('/api/serper/*', serperMockHandler),
  rest.post('/api/firecrawl/*', firecrawlMockHandler),
  rest.post('/api/openai/*', openaiMockHandler),
];
```

### Database Mocking:
- Use Supabase test instance for integration tests
- Mock Supabase client for unit tests
- Seed data for consistent test scenarios

### Performance Testing:
1. **Load Testing**: Simulate high user traffic
2. **API Response Times**: Monitor external service performance
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Track JavaScript bundle size
4. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory leaks in long-running processes

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure:
```
src/
├── __tests__/          # Shared test utilities
├── components/
│   └── __tests__/      # Component tests
├── lib/
│   └── __tests__/      # Library function tests
├── pages/api/
│   └── __tests__/      # API route tests
e2e/
├── tests/              # E2E test scenarios
└── fixtures/           # Test data and fixtures
```

### Test Data Management:
1. **Fixtures**: Static test data for consistent scenarios
2. **Factories**: Dynamic test data generation
3. **Cleanup**: Automatic test data cleanup after each test
4. **Isolation**: Tests don't depend on each other

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Metrics:
- Code coverage percentage and trends
- Test execution time and performance
- Flaky test identification and resolution
- Feature test coverage mapping

### Quality Dashboards:
- Real-time test status in CI/CD
- Coverage reports with detailed breakdowns
- Performance regression tracking
- Security vulnerability monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive:
- High confidence in code quality and reliability
- Early detection of bugs and regressions
- Improved developer productivity with fast feedback
- Consistent user experience across browsers
- Reduced production issues and support overhead

### Negative:
- Initial setup time and learning curve
- Ongoing maintenance of test suites
- Increased build times with comprehensive testing
- Potential for test brittleness if not well-designed

### Mitigations:
- Comprehensive testing documentation and training
- Regular test suite maintenance and refactoring
- Parallel test execution for faster CI/CD
- Focus on resilient test patterns over brittle tests
