# ADR-004: External API Integration Strategy for SEO Services

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-16

## Context
The SEO content generation platform requires integration with multiple external services for data collection and analysis:

- SERP (Search Engine Results Page) analysis
- Web content scraping and extraction
- AI-powered content generation
- Real-time search data
- Competitor analysis capabilities

We need a robust strategy for managing these integrations with proper error handling, rate limiting, and cost optimization.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-service API integration strategy using:
- **Serper.dev** for SERP analysis and search data
- **Firecrawl** for web scraping and content extraction
- **OpenAI API** for AI content generation
- **Centralized API management** with rate limiting and caching

## Rationale

### Service Selection:

#### Serper.dev for SERP Analysis:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports 50+ countries and multiple search engines
2. **Real-time Data**: Live SERP results with rich metadata
3. **Cost Effective**: Competitive pricing compared to alternatives
4. **Reliable API**: High uptime and consistent response times
5. **Developer Friendly**: Good documentation and rate limiting

#### Firecrawl for Web Scraping:
1. **Anti-Detection**: Built-in protection against bot detection
2. **Content Extraction**: Clean HTML to markdown conversion
3. **Performance**: Fast and reliable content retrieval
4. **Scalability**: Handles high-volume scraping needs
5. **Compliance**: Respects robots.txt and rate limiting

#### OpenAI API for Content Generation:
1. **Quality**: State-of-the-art language model capabilities
2. **Flexibility**: Multiple models for different use cases
3. **Integration**: Excellent developer experience and documentation
4. **Cost Control**: Token-based pricing with usage monitoring

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Google Custom Search API**: Limited to 100 queries/day on free tier
- **ScrapingBee/Apify**: More expensive than Firecrawl
- **Anthropic Claude**: Excellent quality but higher costs for high-volume usage

## Implementation Strategy

### API Management Architecture:
```typescript
// Centralized API client with error handling
interface APIClient {
  serper: SerperClient;
  firecrawl: FirecrawlClient;
  openai: OpenAIClient;
}

// Rate limiting and caching layers
interface APIMiddleware {
  rateLimit: RateLimiter;
  cache: CacheManager;
  errorHandler: ErrorHandler;
  usage: UsageTracker;
}
```

### Error Handling & Resilience:
1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic fallback for failed services
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive retry delays
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality when services are down
4. **Health Checks**: Regular monitoring of service availability

### Cost Optimization:
1. **Intelligent Caching**: Cache SERP results for 24 hours, content for 7 days
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent unnecessary API calls
3. **Usage Analytics**: Track and optimize API consumption
4. **Batch Processing**: Combine multiple requests where possible

### Security Measures:
1. **API Key Management**: Secure storage in environment variables
2. **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and control costs
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all external API interactions

## Consequences

### Positive:
- High-quality data from specialized service providers
- Reduced development time by leveraging existing solutions
- Scalable architecture that can handle growing demands
- Cost-effective compared to building internal solutions
- Reliable data sources with good uptime guarantees

### Negative:
- Dependency on external service providers
- Potential for service outages or API changes
- Ongoing costs based on usage volume
- Need for careful rate limit and quota management

### Mitigations:
- Implement comprehensive caching to reduce API calls
- Create fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
- Monitor service health and implement circuit breakers
- Maintain usage analytics for cost optimization
- Evaluate alternative providers periodically

## Environment Configuration

```env
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-[configured]
SERPER_API_KEY=4ce37b02808e4325e42068eb815b03490a5519e5
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-4ba88920f7414c93aadb7f6e8752e6c5

# Rate Limiting
SERPER_RATE_LIMIT=100
FIRECRAWL_RATE_LIMIT=50
OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT=200

# Caching
SERP_CACHE_TTL=86400    # 24 hours
CONTENT_CACHE_TTL=604800 # 7 days
```

## Performance Targets
- SERP Analysis: < 2 seconds response time
- Content Scraping: < 5 seconds per page
- AI Generation: < 30 seconds for 1000 words
- Cache Hit Rate: > 80% for repeat queries
- API Error Rate: < 1%
