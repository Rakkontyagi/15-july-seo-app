# ADR-001: Use Next.js App Router Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-16

## Context
We need to choose the appropriate React framework and routing strategy for the SEO content generation platform. The application requires:

- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- API routes for backend functionality
- Modern React patterns and developer experience
- Scalable architecture for future growth
- TypeScript support
- Built-in optimization features

## Decision
We will use Next.js 15 with the App Router architecture pattern.

## Rationale

### Benefits of Next.js App Router:
1. **Modern React Features**: Built-in support for React Server Components, Suspense, and streaming
2. **SEO Optimization**: Excellent SSR/SSG capabilities essential for an SEO-focused application
3. **File-based Routing**: Intuitive route organization with nested layouts
4. **API Integration**: Seamless API routes with Request/Response handling
5. **Performance**: Built-in image optimization, code splitting, and caching
6. **TypeScript**: First-class TypeScript support
7. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, error boundaries, and debugging tools

### App Router vs Pages Router:
- App Router provides better data fetching patterns with async components
- Improved layout system with nested routing
- Better streaming and loading UI patterns
- Future-proof architecture aligned with React's direction

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Modern development experience with latest React patterns
- Excellent SEO capabilities out of the box
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Built-in optimization features reduce custom configuration
- Seamless API and frontend integration

### Negative:
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with App Router
- Some third-party libraries may need compatibility updates
- Bundle size consideration for client-side JavaScript

### Mitigations:
- Comprehensive documentation and training materials
- Progressive adoption of App Router features
- Regular dependency audits for compatibility
- Code splitting and lazy loading implementation

## Implementation Notes
- Use TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Leverage React Server Components for data fetching
- Follow Next.js 15 best practices for performance optimization
