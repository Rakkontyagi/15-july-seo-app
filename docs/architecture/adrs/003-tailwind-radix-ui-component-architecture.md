# ADR-003: Use Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for Component Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-16

## Context
We need to choose a styling strategy and UI component library for the SEO content generation platform. Requirements include:

- Rapid UI development and prototyping
- Consistent design system
- Accessible components
- Responsive design capabilities
- Developer-friendly workflow
- Maintainable styling approach
- Performance optimization

## Decision
We will use Tailwind CSS v4 as our primary styling framework with Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui component patterns.

## Rationale

### Tailwind CSS Benefits:
1. **Utility-First Approach**: Rapid development with atomic CSS classes
2. **Design Consistency**: Built-in design system with spacing, colors, typography
3. **Performance**: Automatic purging of unused CSS
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive utilities
5. **Developer Experience**: IntelliSense support and rapid iteration
6. **Customization**: Easy theming and custom utility generation

### Radix UI Benefits:
1. **Accessibility**: WAI-ARIA compliant components out of the box
2. **Unstyled Primitives**: Complete control over visual design
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for complex components
4. **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for modals, dropdowns
5. **TypeScript**: First-class TypeScript support
6. **Composition**: Flexible component composition patterns

### shadcn/ui Integration:
1. **Best Practices**: Proven component patterns and implementations
2. **Copy-Paste Components**: Easy customization and modification
3. **Design Tokens**: Consistent theme system
4. **Modern Patterns**: Latest React and TypeScript patterns

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Material-UI**: Too opinionated, harder to customize
- **Chakra UI**: Good but less performant than Tailwind approach
- **Styled Components**: Runtime CSS-in-JS performance concerns
- **CSS Modules**: More verbose, less rapid development

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Extremely fast UI development and iteration
- Excellent accessibility out of the box
- Consistent design system across the application
- Small bundle sizes with automatic purging
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Easy theming and dark mode support

### Negative:
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with utility-first CSS
- HTML can become verbose with many utility classes
- Potential for inconsistent component implementations

### Mitigations:
- Component extraction for reusable patterns
- ESLint rules for Tailwind class ordering
- Design system documentation
- Code review focus on component consistency

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure:
```
src/components/
├── ui/           # Base UI components (Button, Input, etc.)
├── forms/        # Form-specific components
├── content/      # Content generation components
├── analytics/    # Analytics and dashboard components
└── layout/       # Layout and navigation components
```

### Component Patterns:
- Use `cva` (class-variance-authority) for component variants
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistency
- Use Radix primitives for complex interactive components

### Theming Strategy:
- CSS custom properties for theme tokens
- Support for light/dark mode
- Consistent spacing and typography scales
- Brand color palette integration

### Performance Considerations:
- Tailwind CSS v4 with optimized output
- Component-level CSS extraction where beneficial
- Lazy loading for complex UI components
