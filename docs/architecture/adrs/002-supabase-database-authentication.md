# ADR-002: Use Supabase for Database and Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-16

## Context
We need to choose a database and authentication solution for the SEO content generation platform. Requirements include:

- PostgreSQL database with advanced features
- User authentication and authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data privacy
- Real-time capabilities for collaborative features
- Scalable infrastructure
- Developer-friendly API
- Cost-effective for startup phase

## Decision
We will use Supabase as our primary database and authentication provider.

## Rationale

### Database Benefits:
1. **PostgreSQL Foundation**: Full-featured PostgreSQL with extensions support
2. **Row Level Security**: Built-in data privacy and multi-tenancy
3. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live data updates for collaborative features
4. **Advanced Features**: Full-text search, JSON operations, custom functions
5. **Managed Infrastructure**: No database administration overhead
6. **Migration Support**: Version-controlled schema changes

### Authentication Benefits:
1. **JWT-based Auth**: Secure, stateless authentication
2. **Social Providers**: Multiple OAuth integrations
3. **User Management**: Built-in user roles and permissions
4. **Security**: Industry-standard security practices
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with Next.js

### Alternatives Considered:
- **Firebase**: Less SQL capability, vendor lock-in concerns
- **PlanetScale**: Great for MySQL but PostgreSQL preferred for advanced features
- **Self-hosted PostgreSQL + Auth0**: More complex setup and maintenance

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Rapid development with minimal backend setup
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Strong PostgreSQL ecosystem compatibility
- Built-in security best practices
- Real-time capabilities for future features
- Cost-effective scaling model

### Negative:
- Vendor dependency on Supabase
- Learning curve for team members
- Some limitations on database customization
- Migration complexity if switching providers

### Mitigations:
- Use standard PostgreSQL features to minimize vendor lock-in
- Maintain database schema in version control
- Implement data export capabilities
- Regular backup strategies

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema:
- Core tables: users, projects, generated_content
- Supporting tables: serp_analysis, competitor_analysis, usage_analytics
- Proper indexing strategy for performance
- RLS policies for data security

### Authentication Flow:
- JWT tokens for session management
- User profiles with subscription tiers
- Role-based access control
- Secure API key management

### Environment Configuration:
