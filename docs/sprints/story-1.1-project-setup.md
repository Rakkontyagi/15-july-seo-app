# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

**Parent Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure  
**Story Type**: Technical Foundation  
**Priority**: Critical (Must complete first)  
**Estimated Effort**: 8 points  

## Story Statement

As a **developer**,  
I want **a fully configured development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies**,  
so that **I can efficiently develop and test the SEO content generation platform**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Project repository is initialized with monorepo structure supporting frontend, backend, and AI services
2. ✅ Development environment includes Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, and required AI/ML libraries
3. ✅ Docker configuration enables consistent local development across different machines
4. ✅ Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript) are configured and enforced
5. ✅ Basic CI/CD pipeline is established for automated testing and deployment
6. ✅ Environment variables and configuration management system is implemented
7. ✅ Database schema is initialized with user, subscription, and content models

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Monorepo Structure
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript in `/frontend` directory
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API service in `/backend` directory
- **AI Service**: Python FastAPI service in `/ai-service` directory
- **Shared**: Common types and utilities in `/shared` directory
- **Infrastructure**: Docker and deployment configs in `/infrastructure` directory

### 2. Development Dependencies
- **Node.js**: v20.x LTS
- **Python**: 3.11+
- **PostgreSQL**: 15+ (via Docker)
- **Redis**: 7+ (via Docker)
- **Package Managers**: npm for Node.js, pip/poetry for Python

### 3. Docker Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- Service containers for PostgreSQL, Redis
- Development containers for frontend, backend, AI service
- Volume mounts for hot reloading
- Network configuration for inter-service communication

### 4. Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: Configured with Next.js and TypeScript rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting across the project
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type checking
- **Python**: Black formatter, pylint, mypy for type checking
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for:
  - Running tests on pull requests
  - Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
  - Building Docker images
  - Deploying to staging/production
- Environment-specific deployment configurations

### 6. Configuration Management
- `.env.example` files for each service
- Environment variable validation at startup
- Secrets management for production deployment
- Configuration schemas with TypeScript/Pydantic

### 7. Database Schema
- User management tables (users, profiles, preferences)
- Subscription tables (plans, subscriptions, usage_tracking)
- Content tables (projects, articles, competitor_analysis)
- SEO data tables (keywords, lsi_keywords, serp_results)
- Proper indexes and foreign key constraints

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Repository Setup
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Create monorepo directory structure
- [x] Set up .gitignore for each service
- [x] Create README files with setup instructions

### Phase 2: Development Environment
- [x] Create Docker compose configuration
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL and Redis containers
- [x] Configure development containers for each service
- [x] Test inter-service communication

### Phase 3: Frontend Setup
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS and UI components
- [x] Create basic project structure

### Phase 4: Backend Setup
- [x] Initialize Node.js/Express project
- [x] Configure TypeScript and build tools
- [x] Set up database connection and ORM
- [x] Create basic API structure

### Phase 5: AI Service Setup
- [x] Initialize Python FastAPI project
- [x] Configure Poetry for dependency management
- [x] Set up OpenAI and other AI library integrations
- [x] Create basic service structure

### Phase 6: Database Schema
- [x] Create migration system
- [x] Design and implement user tables
- [x] Design and implement subscription tables
- [x] Design and implement content tables

### Phase 7: CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] Create GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Configure automated testing
- [x] Set up deployment workflows
- [x] Configure environment secrets

### Phase 8: Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive README
- [x] Document environment setup process
- [x] Create API documentation structure
- [x] Set up development guidelines

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verified
- [ ] Code passes all linting and formatting checks
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and tests the project
- [ ] Development environment can be set up following README instructions
- [ ] All team members can successfully run the project locally
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Environment variables are properly documented

## Dependencies

- None (this is the first story)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency conflicts between services | High | Use Docker containers to isolate environments |
| Complex setup process | Medium | Provide detailed documentation and scripts |
| Database schema changes | Medium | Use migration system from the start |
| Environment inconsistencies | High | Use Docker for consistent environments |

## Notes

- This story lays the foundation for all subsequent development
- Proper setup here will save significant time in later stories
- Focus on developer experience and ease of onboarding
- Consider creating setup scripts to automate common tasks
