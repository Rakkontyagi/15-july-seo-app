## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.5 established the foundation, authentication, database, deployment, and billing. This story creates the user interface framework.

### UI Framework Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#frontend-stack]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React Context + Zustand
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Responsive Design System
[Source: architecture.md#ui-design-goals]
- **Mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Breakpoints**: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- **Touch optimization**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

- Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Progress tracking for content generation
- Real-time notifications for completed operations
- Connection state management

### Protected Route Implementation
[Source: architecture.md#authentication-authorization]
```typescript
// Protected route wrapper
export function ProtectedRoute({ children, requiredTier = 'free' }) {
  const { user, subscription } = useAuth();
  
  if (!user) {
    redirect('/login');
  }
  
  if (!hasAccess(subscription.tier, requiredTier)) {
    redirect('/upgrade');
  }
  
  return children;
}
```

### Loading States and Error Handling
[Source: architecture.md#error-handling]
- React Error Boundaries for component-level error handling
- Loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

### Accessibility Standards
[Source: architecture.md#accessibility]
- **Target Level**: WCAG AA compliance
- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management

### File Locations
- Layout components: `app/layout.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- UI components: `components/ui/`
- Layout components: `components/layout/`
- Styles: `app/globals.css`
- Types: `types/ui.ts`

### Required Dependencies
- @radix-ui/react-* (UI primitives)
- @headlessui/react (additional UI components)
- clsx (conditional classes)
- tailwind-merge (Tailwind class merging)
- lucide-react (icons)

### Design Tokens
- Colors: Primary, secondary, accent, neutral scales
- Typography: Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- Spacing: Consistent spacing scale (4px base)
- Shadows: Elevation system for depth
- Border radius: Consistent rounding scale

### Performance Considerations
- Code splitting for route-based chunks
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Image optimization with Next.js Image
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization
- Critical CSS inlining

### Testing Standards
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Visual regression testing with Chromatic
- Accessibility testing with axe-core

## QA Results

### Code Quality Assessment - Senior Developer Review
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Review Date:** [DATE]

#### Strengths
- Responsive UI and navigation are well-architected and mapped to ACs.
- Accessibility and mobile-first design are prioritized.
- Real-time features and protected routes are included.

#### Risks/Improvements
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG AA) is validated with automated and manual testing.
- Cross-device and browser testing should be performed regularly.
- Document any custom accessibility features for future maintainers.

#### Testability
- Component, visual regression, and accessibility tests are planned—ensure these are automated and reviewed.
- Performance and UX should be monitored post-launch.

**Status:** APPROVED
