# Story 6.4: Security Hardening and Vulnerability Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** security administrator,
**I want** comprehensive security measures and vulnerability management,
**so that** user data and application integrity are protected against all threats.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated security scanning identifies and alerts for dependency vulnerabilities
2. Penetration testing validates application security against common attack vectors
3. SSL/TLS encryption ensures all data transmission is secure and compliant
4. API security validation prevents unauthorized access and data breaches
5. Regular security audits assess and improve overall application security posture
6. Incident response procedures ensure rapid containment and resolution of security issues
7. Compliance validation ensures adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations
