## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 7.1-7.6 established all individual optimization components. This story creates the comprehensive validation pipeline that orchestrates all quality checks.

### Validation Pipeline Architecture
[Source: System requirements for comprehensive quality assurance]
- **Multi-Stage Processing**: Sequential validation through all optimization layers
- **Quality Scoring**: Comprehensive assessment with pass/fail thresholds
- **Automated Refinement**: Iterative improvement until standards are met
- **Approval Gates**: Prevent substandard content publication

### Quality Validation Pipeline
```typescript
class ContentQualityPipeline {
  async validateContent(content: string, requirements: ContentRequirements): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    const validationStages = [
      this.humanizationValidator,
      this.authorityValidator,
      this.eeatValidator,
      this.seoValidator,
      this.nlpValidator,
      this.userValueValidator
    ];
    
    let currentContent = content;
    const stageResults: StageResult[] = [];
    
    for (const validator of validationStages) {
      const result = await validator.validate(currentContent, requirements);
      stageResults.push(result);
      
      if (result.needsRefinement) {
        currentContent = await validator.refine(currentContent, result.issues);
      }
      
      if (!result.passesThreshold) {
        return this.createFailureResult(stageResults, result.stage);
      }
    }
    
    return this.createSuccessResult(stageResults, currentContent);
  }
}
```

### Quality Scoring System
```typescript
class QualityScorer {
  calculateOverallScore(validationResults: ValidationResult[]): QualityScore {
    const weights = {
      humanization: 0.15,
      authority: 0.20,
      eeat: 0.20,
      seo: 0.25,
      nlp: 0.10,
      userValue: 0.10
    };
    
    const weightedScores = validationResults.map(result => ({
      dimension: result.dimension,
      score: result.score,
      weightedScore: result.score * weights[result.dimension]
    }));
    
    const overallScore = weightedScores.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.weightedScore, 0);
    
    return {
      overallScore,
      dimensionScores: weightedScores,
      passesThreshold: overallScore >= this.QUALITY_THRESHOLD,
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(weightedScores)
    };
  }
}
```

### Automated Refinement Engine
```typescript
class AutomatedRefinementEngine {
  async refineContent(
    content: string, 
    qualityIssues: QualityIssue[], 
    maxIterations: number = 5
  ): Promise<RefinementResult> {
    let currentContent = content;
    let iteration = 0;
    
    while (iteration < maxIterations) {
      const refinementActions = this.prioritizeRefinements(qualityIssues);
      
      for (const action of refinementActions) {
        currentContent = await this.applyRefinement(currentContent, action);
      }
      
      const newQualityScore = await this.assessQuality(currentContent);
      
      if (newQualityScore.passesAllThresholds) {
        return this.createSuccessResult(currentContent, iteration + 1);
      }
      
      qualityIssues = newQualityScore.remainingIssues;
      iteration++;
    }
    
    return this.createPartialSuccessResult(currentContent, qualityIssues);
  }
}
```
