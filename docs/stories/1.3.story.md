# Story 1.3: Supabase Backend Integration and Data Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** platform administrator,
**I want** Supabase-powered backend infrastructure for secure, scalable data management,
**so that** the platform can handle user accounts, content storage, and real-time collaboration efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Supabase PostgreSQL database stores user profiles, content projects, competitor analysis data, and subscription information
2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own content and account data
3. Real-time subscriptions enable live progress updates during content generation and collaboration features
4. Supabase Auth integration handles user registration, login, password reset, and session management
5. Database schemas support complex content structures, LSI keyword storage, and competitor analysis results
6. Automated backups and disaster recovery ensure data integrity and business continuity
7. API security through Supabase service keys and JWT authentication protects all backend operations

  subscription_tier VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'free',
  usage_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Content Projects
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

### Row Level Security Policies
[Source: architecture.md#rls-policies]
All tables require RLS policies to ensure data isolation:
- Users can only access their own data
- Projects are user-scoped
- Generated content is user-scoped
- Analytics data is user-scoped

### Supabase Client Configuration
[Source: architecture.md#backend-stack]
- Browser client: `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Auth helpers: `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`
- Server-side operations with service role key
- Environment variables: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

### Real-time Features
[Source: architecture.md#real-time-processing]
- Live progress updates during content generation
- Real-time collaboration features
- WebSocket connections for instant updates
- Connection state management

### File Locations
[Source: architecture.md#frontend-application-structure]
- Supabase clients: `lib/supabase/` directory
- Database utilities: `lib/database/` directory
- Migration files: `supabase/migrations/` directory
- Types: `types/database.ts`

### Required Extensions
- uuid-ossp: For UUID generation
- pg_stat_statements: For query performance monitoring

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#security-implementation]
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Row-level security for data isolation
- JWT authentication for all operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all database functions
- Integration tests for real-time subscriptions
- Test RLS policies with different user contexts
- Mock Supabase client in tests
- Test migration scripts and rollbacks

## QA Results

### Code Quality Assessment - Senior Developer Review
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
**Review Date:** [DATE]

#### Strengths
- Database and backend integration are comprehensive and well-structured.
- RLS and security policies are clearly defined and mapped to ACs.
- Real-time features and monitoring are included, showing strong architectural foresight.
- Migration and rollback procedures are documented.

#### Risks/Improvements
- Ensure all RLS policies are tested with different user contexts.
- Automated backup and disaster recovery should be periodically validated.
- Document any manual steps for database setup and migration.

#### Testability
- Unit, integration, and migration tests are planned—ensure these are automated in CI.
- Mocking and health checks are good practices; maintain coverage as schema evolves.

**Status:** APPROVED
