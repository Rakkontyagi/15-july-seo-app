# Story 2.1: Advanced SERP Analysis with Serper.dev Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** content creator,
**I want** the system to automatically discover and analyze the top 5 ranking pages using Serper.dev API,
**so that** I can understand what content performs best in search results across different geographic regions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Serper.dev API integration retrieves top 5 organic search results for any keyword and location with high accuracy
2. Regional targeting supports multiple Google domains (google.com, google.ae, google.co.uk) for geo-specific competitor analysis
3. Search result filtering excludes ads, shopping results, and knowledge panels to focus on organic content pages
4. API rate limiting and error handling ensures reliable search result retrieval and cost optimization
5. Results validation confirms pages are accessible and contain substantial content for analysis
6. Backup search providers (SerpApi, ScrapingBee) provide failover options for continuous service availability
7. Search result caching optimizes API usage and provides faster results for repeated keyword searches

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Epic 1 established the complete application foundation. This story begins Epic 2 by building the SERP analysis engine that powers competitor research.

### Serper.dev API Integration
[Source: architecture.md#external-services-layer]
- **Primary Provider**: Serper.dev for Google SERP analysis
- **Backup Providers**: SerpApi, ScrapingBee for failover
- **Regional Support**: Multiple Google domains for geo-targeting
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in quota management and cost optimization

### SERP Analysis Service Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#serp-analysis-service]
```typescript
class SERPAnalysisService {
  private primaryProvider: SerperProvider;
  private backupProvider: SerpApiProvider;
  
  async analyzeKeyword(keyword: string, location: string): Promise<SERPResults> {
    try {
      const results = await this.primaryProvider.search(keyword, location);
      return this.processResults(results);
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warn('Primary SERP provider failed, using backup');
      const results = await this.backupProvider.search(keyword, location);
      return this.processResults(results);
    }
  }
}
```

### Regional Targeting Configuration
[Source: PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- **Multi-region Support**: google.com, google.ae, google.co.uk, google.com.au
- **Location-specific Analysis**: Cultural adaptation and local search patterns
- **Regional Competitor Discovery**: Focus on geo-specific top-ranking pages

### Database Schema for SERP Results
[Source: architecture.md#database-schema]
```sql
CREATE TABLE serp_analysis (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  keyword VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  results JSONB NOT NULL,
  top_competitors JSONB NOT NULL,
  analysis_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'
);
```

### Search Result Filtering Logic
[Source: PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- **Organic Results Only**: Exclude ads, shopping results, knowledge panels
- **Content Quality Validation**: Ensure pages contain substantial content
- **Accessibility Checks**: Verify URLs are accessible and scrapable
- **Duplicate Detection**: Remove duplicate or similar results

### API Rate Limiting Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#api-reliability]
- **Request Queuing**: Intelligent request scheduling
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive retry delays
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Quota Monitoring**: Real-time usage tracking and alerts

### Caching Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#caching-strategy]
```typescript
class CacheService {
  async cacheCompetitorAnalysis(
    keyword: string,
    location: string,
    data: CompetitorAnalysis[],
    ttl: number = 3600
  ): Promise<void> {
    const key = `competitor:${keyword}:${location}`;
    await this.redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(data));
  }
}
```

### Error Handling and Resilience
[Source: architecture.md#fault-tolerance]
- **Provider Failover**: Automatic switching to backup providers
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial results when some providers fail
- **Error Classification**: Distinguish between temporary and permanent failures
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and retry options

### File Locations
[Source: architecture.md#frontend-application-structure]
- SERP service: `lib/serp/serper-client.ts`
- API endpoints: `app/api/serp/`
- Data models: `types/serp.ts`
- Caching utilities: `lib/cache/serp-cache.ts`

### Required Dependencies

### Environment Variables
- SERPER_API_KEY (primary search provider)
- SERPAPI_API_KEY (backup provider)
- SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY (additional backup)
- REDIS_URL (caching)

### Performance Considerations
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent API calls where possible
- **Result Caching**: 24-hour TTL for search results
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple keywords efficiently
- **Memory Management**: Efficient data structures for large result sets

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#security-implementation]
- **API Key Security**: Secure storage and rotation
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize keywords and location parameters
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and quota exhaustion
- **Audit Logging**: Track all SERP analysis requests

### Testing Standards
