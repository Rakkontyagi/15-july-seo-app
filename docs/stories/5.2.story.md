# Story 5.2: Authority External Linking and Citation Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** content authority builder,
**I want** intelligent external linking to high-authority sources and citation integration,
**so that** my content builds trust and authority through strategic external references.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Authority domain identification automatically discovers Wikipedia, government, and industry authority sources
2. Contextual relevance matching ensures external links support and enhance content topics
3. Citation integration includes proper attribution and reference formatting for authoritative sources
4. Link value assessment prioritizes external links to highest domain authority and topical relevance
5. Natural link placement ensures external links enhance content flow without appearing manipulative
6. Source verification confirms external link destinations maintain authority and current information
7. Link monitoring tracks external link health and updates broken or redirected authority links

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build authority domain identification (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement contextual relevance matching (AC: 2)

### Code Quality Assessment
This story is crucial for building content authority through strategic external linking and citation integration. The acceptance criteria are comprehensive, covering authority domain identification, contextual relevance, citation integration, link value assessment, natural placement, source verification, and link monitoring. The tasks are well-defined and cover the necessary components for implementation.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring was performed as this is a review of the story's readiness, not the code implementation.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ (Assumed to follow the project's established coding standards.)
- Project Structure: ✓ (No specific file locations are mentioned, but the tasks imply modular components that would fit the existing structure.)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Testing standards are explicitly mentioned, including unit tests for domain identification and integration tests for citation integration.)
- All ACs Met: ✗ (Tasks for AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7 are incomplete. The story status is "Ready for Development" but these tasks are not marked as complete.)

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Complete the remaining tasks for AC4, AC5, AC6, and AC7 to ensure the story is fully ready for development.
- [ ] Specify the databases or APIs for "authority domain identification" (e.g., Moz, Ahrefs, custom curated lists). How will the system prioritize different types of authority sources?
- [ ] Detail the algorithms for "contextual relevance matching" to ensure external links truly support and enhance content topics. Will it leverage existing content analysis from Epic 2?
- [ ] Clarify the implementation of "citation integration." Will it support different citation styles (e.g., APA, MLA)? How will it handle dynamic content updates?
- [ ] Outline the methodology for "link value assessment" and "natural link placement." How will the system balance SEO value with user experience and avoid manipulative linking?
- [ ] Consider the legal and ethical implications of linking to external sources, especially regarding content accuracy and potential liability.

### Security Review
Ensure that external link destinations are verified for security and do not lead to malicious sites. If any external APIs are used for domain authority checking, ensure secure API key management. The system should respect `robots.txt` directives of external sites.

### Performance Considerations
Fetching and analyzing external domain authority can be time-consuming. Consider caching mechanisms for frequently accessed authority domains. Link monitoring should be implemented asynchronously to avoid impacting content generation performance.

### Final Status
✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above

This story is well-defined but requires completion of the remaining tasks before it can be considered fully ready for development. The focus on external linking and authority building is crucial for content credibility. The identified improvements are primarily about detailing the technical implementation and addressing the incomplete tasks.
