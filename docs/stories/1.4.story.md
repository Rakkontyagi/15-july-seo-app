**Fix Applied:** Updated to specific domain restriction
```json
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://yourdomain.com"
```

#### 2. **Interface Definition Improvement**

```typescript
export interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {
  error?: boolean;
}
```

#### 3. **Linting Issues Identified**
**Status:** 58 warnings, 54 errors found during review
**Primary Issues:**
- Extensive use of `any` types (security risk)
- Unused variables and imports
- Unescaped quotes in JSX
- Missing proper TypeScript interfaces
