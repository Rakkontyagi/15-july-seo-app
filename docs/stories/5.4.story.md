# Story 5.4: Advanced Content Optimization Features

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** content marketer,
**I want** advanced optimization features that go beyond basic keyword density,
**so that** I can create content that truly competes at the highest level.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Topical clustering analysis ensures content covers all relevant subtopics comprehensively
2. Content gap analysis identifies missing topics compared to top-ranking competitors
3. Semantic optimization enhances content with conceptually related terms and phrases
4. Readability optimization adjusts content complexity for target audience comprehension
5. Content freshness optimization includes current events and recent developments
6. User intent optimization aligns content with different search intent types (informational, commercial, navigational)
7. Featured snippet optimization formats content for position zero opportunities

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build topical clustering analysis (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement content gap analysis (AC: 2)
- [x] Create semantic optimization (AC: 3)
- [x] Build readability optimization (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement content freshness optimization (AC: 5)
- [x] Create user intent optimization (AC: 6)
- [x] Build featured snippet optimization (AC: 7)
