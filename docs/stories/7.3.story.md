## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 7.1-7.2 established humanization and authority validation. This story adds comprehensive E-E-A-T optimization for maximum search engine trust.

### E-E-A-T Optimization Architecture
[Source: Google's E-E-A-T guidelines and system requirements]
- **Experience**: Personal insights and practical applications
- **Expertise**: Technical accuracy and specialized knowledge
- **Authoritativeness**: Citations and industry recognition
- **Trustworthiness**: Transparency and balanced perspectives

### E-E-A-T Analysis System
```typescript
class EEATOptimizer {
  analyzeEEAT(content: string): EEATAnalysis {
    return {
      experience: this.assessExperienceMarkers(content),
      expertise: this.evaluateExpertiseLevel(content),
      authoritativeness: this.measureAuthoritySignals(content),
      trustworthiness: this.analyzeTrustElements(content),
      overallScore: this.calculateEEATScore(content)
    };
  }
  
  optimizeEEAT(content: string): string {
    let optimizedContent = content;
    
    // Enhance each E-E-A-T component
    optimizedContent = this.addExperienceMarkers(optimizedContent);
    optimizedContent = this.enhanceExpertise(optimizedContent);
    optimizedContent = this.addAuthoritySignals(optimizedContent);
    optimizedContent = this.integrateTrustElements(optimizedContent);
    
    return optimizedContent;
  }
}
```

### E-E-A-T Signal Database
```sql
CREATE TABLE eeat_signals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  signal_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'experience', 'expertise', 'authoritativeness', 'trustworthiness'
  signal_category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  signal_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  industry VARCHAR(100),
  effectiveness_score DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
