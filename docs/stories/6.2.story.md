# Story 6.2: Production Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** automated deployment pipeline with comprehensive quality checks,
**so that** only thoroughly tested, error-free code reaches production environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated CI/CD pipeline runs comprehensive test suite on every code commit
2. Staging environment mirrors production for thorough testing before deployment
3. Automated deployment to Vercel includes environment validation and health checks
4. Database migration scripts ensure zero-downtime updates to Supabase schema
5. Rollback mechanisms enable immediate reversion to previous stable version if issues arise
6. Deployment notifications alert team of successful deployments and any issues detected
7. Blue-green deployment strategy eliminates downtime during application updates

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build automated CI/CD pipeline (AC: 1)
- [x] Create staging environment (AC: 2)
- [x] Implement automated Vercel deployment (AC: 3)
- [x] Build database migration scripts (AC: 4)
- [x] Create rollback mechanisms (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement deployment notifications (AC: 6)
- [x] Build blue-green deployment strategy (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
[Source: PRD.md#production-readiness]
- **Automated Pipeline**: Comprehensive test suite on every commit
- **Staging Environment**: Production mirror for testing
- **Zero-downtime**: Database migrations and blue-green deployment
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Immediate reversion capabilities
