# Story 2.6: API Reliability and Fallback Systems

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** content creator,
**I want** guaranteed API reliability with comprehensive fallback systems,
**so that** content generation never fails due to external service issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Primary API integration with Serper.dev includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic
2. Fallback search providers (SerpApi, ScrapingBee) automatically activate when primary service fails
3. Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures and provides graceful degradation
4. API rate limiting prevents quota exhaustion and includes intelligent request queuing
5. Timeout management ensures requests don't hang indefinitely and provide user feedback
6. Error classification distinguishes between temporary failures and permanent issues
7. Service health monitoring tracks API performance and automatically switches to backup providers

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 2.1-2.5 established the web scraping and analysis engine. This story ensures reliability through comprehensive fallback systems.

### API Reliability Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#api-reliability]
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Fallback Providers**: Multiple backup services
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous service availability tracking

### Circuit Breaker Implementation
[Source: architecture.md#fault-tolerance]
```typescript
class CircuitBreaker {
  private state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN' = 'CLOSED';
  private failureCount = 0;
  private lastFailureTime = 0;
  
  async execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() - this.lastFailureTime > this.timeout) {
        this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
      } else {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
