# Story 6.1: Comprehensive Application Monitoring and Error Tracking

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** platform administrator,
**I want** real-time application monitoring and comprehensive error tracking,
**so that** I can identify and resolve issues before they impact users and maintain 99.9% uptime.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sentry integration captures, categorizes, and alerts for all application errors with detailed stack traces
2. Real-time performance monitoring tracks response times, API latency, and user interaction metrics
3. User behavior analytics identify usage patterns, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities
4. Automated alerting notifies administrators immediately of critical errors or performance degradation
5. Error dashboard provides comprehensive overview of application health and issue trends
6. Performance metrics tracking monitors Vercel function execution times and Supabase query performance
7. Custom monitoring dashboards display key business metrics and user engagement data

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Set up Sentry integration (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement real-time performance monitoring (AC: 2)
- [x] Build user behavior analytics (AC: 3)
- [x] Create automated alerting system (AC: 4)
- [x] Build error dashboard (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement performance metrics tracking (AC: 6)
- [x] Create custom monitoring dashboards (AC: 7)
