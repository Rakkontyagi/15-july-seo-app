## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.8 established the complete application foundation. This final story ensures perfect visual consistency and responsive design.

### Responsive Design Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#responsive-design]
- **Mobile-first approach**: Design for mobile, enhance for larger screens
- **Breakpoint system**: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- **Fluid typography**: Responsive font sizes using clamp() and viewport units
- **Flexible layouts**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts

### Visual Regression Testing Setup
