# Story 1.5: Subscription Management and Billing Integration

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - 100% Complete

## Story

4. Billing dashboard allows users to view invoices, update payment methods, and manage subscriptions
5. Automatic subscription renewal with email notifications for upcoming charges through Supabase Edge Functions
6. Graceful handling of failed payments with retry logic and account suspension using Supabase workflows
7. Prorated billing for subscription upgrades and downgrades during billing cycles

serve(async (req) => {
  const signature = req.headers.get('stripe-signature');
  const body = await req.text();
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, signature, webhookSecret);
  
  // Handle different event types
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'customer.subscription.created':
    case 'customer.subscription.updated':
    case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
    case 'invoice.payment_succeeded':
    case 'invoice.payment_failed':
