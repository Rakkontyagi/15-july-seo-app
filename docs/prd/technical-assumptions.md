# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure
**Monorepo**: Single repository containing Vercel-optimized frontend, Supabase backend integration, AI services, and shared utilities for streamlined development and deployment

## Service Architecture
**Serverless-First Architecture**: Vercel serverless functions for frontend and API processing, Supabase for backend services and database, with specialized microservices for AI content generation and web scraping operations

## Testing Requirements
**Bulletproof Quality Assurance Strategy**: Comprehensive testing suite with 95%+ code coverage, automated testing pipelines, integration testing for all external APIs (Firecrawl, Serper.dev, Supabase), end-to-end testing for complete user workflows, performance testing under load, security testing for vulnerabilities, and continuous monitoring with error tracking and real-time alerting

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
