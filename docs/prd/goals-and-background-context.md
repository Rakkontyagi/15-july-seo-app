# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create an AI-powered SaaS platform that automatically generates SEO-optimized content by analyzing top-ranking competitors
- Eliminate manual SEO research and content optimization for users with one-click content generation
- Provide comprehensive competitor analysis including keyword density, heading structure, and LSI keyword extraction
- Deliver ready-to-publish content that matches or exceeds competitor SEO performance
- Build a scalable subscription-based business serving content creators, agencies, and businesses

## Background Context
The SEO content creation market currently requires significant manual research and optimization work. Existing tools like Surfer SEO, Clearscope, and Frase provide analysis but still require manual content creation. This system aims to fully automate the entire process from competitor analysis to final content generation, providing a complete solution that analyzes the top 5 ranking pages for any keyword and automatically generates optimized content that matches competitor benchmarks.
